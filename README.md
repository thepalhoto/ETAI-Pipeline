Logistic Regression outperformed the Decision Tree across all key metrics. It achieved higher test accuracy (67.8% vs. 63.1%) and avoided the Decision Tree's overfitting (82.9% train vs. 63.1% test). It also caught significantly more cases of reoffenders, with a recall of 0.60 compared to the tree's 0.49 (less than half).

COMPAS originally mislabeled Black defendants as "high risk" far more often than White defendants, presenting a 19% gap. Logistic Regression narrowed it down to 9%.

# Baseline Predictive Pipeline -- ETAI

This is the **starting point** for your semester project: a small but *complete* predictive pipeline -- every piece a real project needs (entry point, config, data loading, preprocessing, model, evaluation), just kept as simple as possible for now.

The task: predict two-year recidivism using ProPublica's COMPAS
dataset -- the data behind a real 2016 investigation into a risk-
assessment algorithm actually used by US courts to help inform bail and sentencing decisions. See `data/README.md` for the full problem description and a complete data dictionary before you start.

It has some **deliberately weak spots**. Part of your work this
semester is finding them and making them better -- see the pipeline progress table below, which tracks what changes and why as the weeks
go on.

## Pipeline progress

This table is updated after each practical class, so you can always see what changed in the pipeline and why -- it's a running log, not a fixed syllabus.

| Week | Practical class focus | Added to the pipeline |
|------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 2 | Introduction & baseline pipeline | Initial version: project structure, a single naive train/test split (no cross-validation), minimal preprocessing (drop rows with missing values, one-hot encode categoricals), logistic regression baseline, a first (deliberately simple) fairness check comparing our model's and COMPAS's own false-positive rate by race, train-vs-test accuracy reporting (to start spotting overfitting), and each run's full report saved automatically to `results/` |
| 3 | EDA + preprocessing -- diagnose the data, then fix it | `src/data_diagnostics.py` (missingness-mechanism test via chi-square + Cramér's V, domain-rule invalid-value detection, two-way duplicate check) and `src/preprocessing.py` (leak-safe category cleanup, mechanism-matched imputation with `_was_missing` indicators for MNAR columns, a deployable `ColumnTransformer`, **and** the train/test split itself, all in the one file rather than split across two) replace the old naive `dropna()`/`pd.get_dummies()` preprocessing; encoder/scaler pair (count encoding + robust scaling) chosen by an empirical grid over 15 repeated splits, checked against the runner-up with a paired comparison so the win isn't just noise; three redundant columns (found via correlation + VIF) dropped; `config.yaml` gains `diagnostics` and `preprocessing` sections -- see "Preprocessing decisions" below. |

## Preprocessing decisions

*(New this week -- written straight from the diagnosis in `Practical/W3/notebooks/01_eda_introduction.ipynb` and the empirical grid in `02_preprocessing.ipynb`. Full walkthrough lives in those two notebooks; this is the summary.)*

| Column(s) | Issue found | Mechanism | What was done |
|---|---|---|---|
| `age` | 2.0% missing | MCAR | median impute, no indicator needed |
| `juv_fel_count` | 3.0% missing | MCAR | median impute, no indicator needed |
| `priors_count` | ~7% missing (incl. placeholder tokens) | MNAR -- tied to `age_cat` | median impute + `priors_count_was_missing` flag |
| `c_charge_degree` | 3.2% missing | MNAR -- tied to `age_cat` | mode impute + `c_charge_degree_was_missing` flag |
| `race` | ~1% missing (placeholder tokens) | MCAR | mode impute, no indicator (excluded from model features anyway) |
| `sex` | ~1.5% missing (incl. placeholder tokens) | MCAR | mode impute, no indicator needed |
| `age`, `decile_score`, `juv_fel_count`, `priors_count` | invalid values (out-of-range or negative) | domain rule | converted to `NaN` before imputation |
| `sex` / `race` / `c_charge_degree` / `score_text` | inconsistent category spelling (casing, whitespace, abbreviations) | data entry | canonicalized to one spelling per category |
| whole rows | 72 exact-duplicate rows, all sharing a repeated `id` | data entry | dropped, kept first occurrence |
| `prior_offenses`, `age_in_months`, `juvenile_total` | redundant with other columns (correlation r=1.00, or -- for `juvenile_total` -- an exact sum caught only by VIF) | multicollinearity | dropped |

**Encoder/scaler pair:** chosen empirically -- 4 encoders (one-hot, ordinal, count, target) × 4 scalers (none, standard, min-max, robust), scored by mean accuracy across 15 repeated train/test splits with logistic regression. **Target encoding + standard scaling won**, though a paired comparison against the runner-up (same 15 splits, per-split difference) showed the margin was within noise -- see `02_preprocessing.ipynb`'s grid + paired-comparison cells for the full table and the check itself.

## Environment setup

You only need to do this once per machine.

### macOS / Linux
```bash
python3 -m venv venv                 # creates an isolated Python environment in a folder called "venv"
source venv/bin/activate             # activates it -- packages install here, not system-wide, and stay out of your other projects
pip install -r requirements.txt      # installs the exact packages this project needs, into that environment
```

### Windows -- PowerShell
```powershell
python -m venv venv                  # creates an isolated Python environment in a folder called "venv"
venv\Scripts\activate                # activates it -- packages install here, not system-wide, and stay out of your other projects
pip install -r requirements.txt      # installs the exact packages this project needs, into that environment
```
If PowerShell blocks the activation script, run this once first:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

### Windows -- cmd.exe
Same three steps as above, just with cmd's own activation command:
```cmd
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the environment is active you'll see `(venv)` at the start of your prompt. To leave it later, run `deactivate` (same command on every OS).

### Every time after the first

Creating the environment and installing packages only needs to happen once, ever. Every other time you sit down to work -- a new terminal window, the next practical class, tomorrow -- you don't repeat any of the steps above. From the project's root folder, you just need to:

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

**Windows**
```powershell
venv\Scripts\activate
python main.py
```

That's it -- activate, then run. If you don't see `(venv)` at the start of your prompt, the environment isn't active and `python main.py` may use the wrong Python (or fail to find a package) entirely.

## Environment Troubleshooting

Two Windows issues come up often enough to note here -- if you hit either, this saves you re-diagnosing it from scratch.

**PowerShell blocks the venv activation script, every new terminal.** The `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass` line above only fixes it for that one terminal window -- close it and it's back. For a fix that actually sticks across sessions, run this **once**, instead:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```
If it still doesn't stick (common on locked-down school/lab machines with a Group Policy that resets it on every logon), skip PowerShell entirely: use **Git Bash** (`source venv/Scripts/activate`) or **cmd.exe** (`venv\Scripts\activate.bat`) instead -- neither is affected by PowerShell's execution policy.

**Windows blocks the terminal/Python from reading or writing files in Documents (or Desktop/Pictures).** Shows up as an "Access is denied" error, or a silent failure to create/update a file, only when the project sits inside one of those folders. Two independent settings can cause this -- check both:
- **Windows Security -> Virus & threat protection -> Manage ransomware protection** -- turn off **Controlled folder access**, or add your terminal/Python/editor to its allowed-apps list.
- **Settings -> Privacy & security -> File system** -- make sure the terminal/Python has access.

## Running the pipeline

With the environment active (see above), from the project's root
folder, on any OS:
```bash
python main.py
```

This loads `config.yaml`, diagnoses and cleans the data (week 3's `data_diagnostics.py`/`preprocessing.py`), preprocesses and trains the model, and prints:
- **train accuracy and test accuracy, side by side.** Comparing the two is how you catch overfitting: if the model looks much better on the data it was trained on than on data it's never seen, it has memorised rather than learned something that generalises.
- a classification report on the test set
- a false-positive-rate-by-race comparison between our model and
  COMPAS's own score

All of this is also saved to a timestamped file in `results/` (e.g.`results/run_20260916_143012.txt`), so it doesn't just scroll past in your terminal -- open it later, or change something in `config.yaml` (like the model type) and compare the new file to the last one.
`results/` is created automatically the first time you run the pipeline, and isn't tracked in git (see `.gitignore`) since it's generated output, not source.

You're free to improve on this structure or restructure it entirely -- what matters is that your project stays runnable end-to-end with a single command, and that each piece (data, preprocessing, model, evaluation) stays easy to find and change independently.

## Push to GitHub via Terminal

Standard workflow, from the project's root folder, with the venv active:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "short description of what changed"
git push
```

**If `git push` asks for a password and rejects your normal GitHub password:** GitHub no longer accepts account passwords for git over HTTPS -- you need a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** instead.
1. On GitHub: **Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens -> Tokens (classic)** -> **Generate new token**, with at least `repo` scope.
2. When `git push` prompts for a password, paste the token instead (username stays your GitHub username).
3. So you're not asked every time: `git config --global credential.helper manager` (Windows, usually already set up by Git for Windows) or `git config --global credential.helper store` (caches it in plaintext -- fine on a personal machine, not a shared one).

Alternative: set up an SSH key once (`ssh-keygen -t ed25519`, then add the public key under **GitHub -> Settings -> SSH and GPG keys**) and use the repo's SSH remote URL (`git@github.com:...`) instead of HTTPS -- no token to manage or renew.
